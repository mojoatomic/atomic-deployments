## Is this in scope?

This script intentionally does one thing: atomic symlink swaps. 

These are **out of scope** (use other tools):
- [ ] Shared directory management → use Capistrano or custom script
- [ ] Remote deployment → wrap with rsync/ssh
- [ ] Release pruning → use cron
- [ ] Service restarts → use systemd/pm2/etc.
- [ ] Container deployment → use k8s/docker

If your request fits one of these, please reconsider.
